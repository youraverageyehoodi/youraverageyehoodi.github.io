title: The Forgotten Story of the New Ancestral Galilean Hebrew Dialect
categories: Language

Learning about the Hebrew language and its various forms as a Jewish teenager who grew up in Israel is interesting, 
because for some reason, we all tend to think that we speak a 3,000 year old language in the same way that 'Moses spoke it',
or at least, in a generally close form of that, however that couldn't be further from the truth. Learning about the different
pronunciations of Hebrew has opened my eyes to its middle eastern allure, which, unfortunately, is not experienced nor realized in modern times. <br /><br />
Today, we will go over the story of the man, who, at the end of the 19th century, revived an ancient Hebrew accent.

## The Story of Yitzhak Epstein

Yitzhak Epstein was born in Lyuban, Belarus in the year of 1862, to a Hebrew teacher (Nahum), and his wife, Bella Feiga. He grew up in a
religious / traditional Jewish environment. At the age of 14, he left for a school in the city of Odessa, where he continued his studies
of the Hebrew language and literature, and also discovered his burning love for teaching. He made Aliyah in 1886 after failing
to get accepted to a university in order to learn agriculture, simply because he was Jewish. He learned agriculture in Israel 
on the invitation of Edmond James de Rothschild and as part of a movement called 'Hovevei Zion', so he may later guide New Olim
instead of the French guides, who didn't understand the Zionist spirit.

He later became the principal of a girls' school in Safed for 5 years (starting from 1891), where he taught the Hebrew language.
Guests who came from nearby or overseas were often **highly** impressed by his accomplishments, and the correct and clear accent which
he instilled in them, more than the content he taught. He was renowned for being an "artist-teacher".

Due to missing the rural and agricultural lifestyle, he moved to Metula, where he taught various subjects at the town's school
for two years. He taught Hebrew by **his methods**, which he continued to develop and enhance. Countless teachers and students
from all over the country came to the school in Metula simply because of the good name Yitzhak acquired for himself.

## The Galilean Dialect
Upon becoming a teacher in the Galilee, he dedicated much thought for developing a distinct Galilean dialect
based on the need for regional pride, but also because he knew the local Arabic dialect, and the special and ancient
Hebrew dialect that was preserved by the Jewish community of Hasbaya, a town in southern Lebanon. Based on his experiences
learning Arabic and its proper, guttural pronunciation, he started to develop his own Hebrew accent; one which was
pretty close in some ways to that of First Temple Hebrew.

#### The notable signs of the Galilean dialect:
- The most notable sign of the Galilean accent was the lack of Beged-Kefet (בגד כפת), meaning a relaxed Bet (vet, ב as in haveev)
would turn into an emphasized Bet (בּ, as in Habeeb), and the same thing would apply to 'K' not being 'Ch' (so "Melech", meaning king,
would be "Melek"), 'T' not being 'Th', and so on so forth. This was also a very prominent feature of First Temple Hebrew.
- It was spoken with מלרע, a prosodic stress which was present in ancient Hebrew, as well as accents of the MENA and 
Sephardi diasporas, and pretty much any other widely known middle eastern language. 
- The accent preserved all the guttural sounds of Hebrew - Het (ח), 'Ayin (ע), Quf (ק), 'Tet (ט), etc. 
- It pronounced Qamas' as Patah, and not as Holam, like in the Ashkenazi accent.

We still have no way of knowing for sure how close this accent was to that of First Temple Hebrew, because many sounds that we
nowadays correlate to certain letters could have been different. Nonetheless, I think this is by far the oldest
Hebrew accent I've seen being spoken in relatively modern times.

## Spread and Later Decline
The Galilean dialect is said to have spread from Metula until Menahemia, however, it was unfortunately short-lived.
In 1913, David Yellin, one of the founders of the Hebrew Language Committee, declared that the existence of a different
accent in the Galilee mustn't be allowed, because it has the potential of damaging accentual uniformity.

## Closing Thoughts
Personally, I find the concept of a unique accent in the Galilee, specifically one that is much closer to Jewish roots,
and also very phonetically close to the nearby Arab environment, a pretty cool concept. I understand why it didn't last,
but in my opinion, it's a damn shame that we are not taught things of this sort in Hebrew (לשון / הבעה) lessons during
high school, but rather taught useless grammar that we all forget about in less than two months after finishing the subject.
It's a shame that the Galilean dialect isn't given any attention, anywhere.
